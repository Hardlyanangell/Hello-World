# Hello-World

We all know there's a lot I could say right now...
but to cut it short.. Everyone makes mistakes..
some more than others but someone's gotta be the
shitty role model round here.. Surprise.. It's 
me! But I commit to being a better me at being
me as long as moon tacos are included so I 
don't get hangry.. even the snack needs snacks
sometimes.. 
Remember kids - say it with me :
                don't. play. with. fire..
