# Hello-World

We all know there's a lot I could say right now...
but to cut it short.. Everyone makes mistakes..
some more than others but someone's gotta be the
shitty role model round here.. Surprise.. It's 
me! But I commit to being a better me at being
me as long as moon tacos are included so I 
don't get hangry.. even the snack needs snacks.. 
But watch how much you feed the fire for the
smores cause when the heat gets turned up people get 
burnt intentionally unintentionally... either
way it's the person holding the flamethrower 
responsible.. it's me.. I'm that person.. it's my own
downfall.. I fucked up the best thing I could've 
not fucked up for once.. my mouth and attitude 
does that alot.. it puts me in situations so 
often that I'm used to fighting as a first reaction.
Sometimes that fighting is a jab back that 
completely degrades myself but the fumes be so
lit I don't care that I'm doing it no matter the
outcome. I'm sorry for that.. it won't happen again 
I promise that! On everything.. I know I don't have 
much.. and that I'm a handful as fuck.. but that's 
why you got 2 hands.. to hold me closer to earth's 
reality instead of imagining my false reality 
because I assumed fuck shit was indeed fuck shit
before fuck shit was ever fuck shit which makes 
me look like a completely fucking shitty person. 
Because I am. Its inevitable. Shit happens.. it just..
Happens.. but I vow to stay gravitated.. space is
gay anyways. I want nothing more than to stay grounded 
with peace of mind in the midst of the madness.. I'm sorry
I fucked shit up.. but deep down.. I know I'd do anything
to fix the regratful mistake(s) that made you(s) feel any type
of way due to my fuck shit. I can't take it back but..
I can try to make up for it and move on with the shit show with
anyone as long as they're ready to forgive me while I forgive myself 
too.. it takes alot.. I know.. but it's possible.. I hate myself enough 
already.. it hurts.. I'm such a beautiful disaster I know but.. 
There's no but. I'm just a beautiful disaster.. 75% disaster though..
And can only see 5 of the 25 % of beauty in myself..
I give up, give in, I give me.. the real me.. you'll see..
 
Sincerely..
Ember.. the new tameable Ember..
